# Slide Design Lab


Design:
1. Use slidecarnival to find a template for your presentation
2. Add the relevant text and visualization to each slide, making sure to use the template format and styles
3. Make sure to include slide numbers

Declutter:
3. For text-heavy slides, ask "what can be moved to slide notes?"
4. Can your slide titles be reduced to seven words or less?
5. Is the text large enough to be read on screen?
5. How many visuals do you have per slide? 
6. Does each visualization convey *one* point? 
7. Can you reduce the visualization to slide ratio down to 1:1.
6. Do your visuals cover at least 60% of the slide?

Deconstruct:
 Do your visualization have all the necessary components?
